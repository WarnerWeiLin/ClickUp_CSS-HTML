# ClickUp_CSS_Project

Instructions


Turn the design into responsive html/css.



Submit your work to bls@clickup.com, aaron@clickup.com, konstantin@clickup.com, and alex@clickup.com.



Here are some guidelines:


1. BEM https://en.bem.info/methodology/key-concepts/

2. Pure html/css. We do not use Bootstrap as well as other exterior frameworks.

3. Any preprocessor at your choice. We use SCSS.

4. We're looking for pixel perfect and attention to details.

5. Using grunt/gulp/webpack will be a benefit.
